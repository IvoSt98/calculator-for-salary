[Lived project can be viewed here](https://calculator-for-salary-6e04ba66476c.herokuapp.com/).

The Salary/Income Calculator is an open-source, interactive command-line utility tailored for efficient income and expense management. It applies the 40/40/20 rule, a guiding principle in wealth creation. According to this rule, 40% of your gross income should be allocated for taxes/needs, another 40% should be saved/invested, and the remaining 20% should cover living expenses. This tool simplifies financial tracking, ensuring users can easily implement this strategy to optimize their savings and budgeting efforts.
